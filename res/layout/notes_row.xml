	This is the View that will be used for each notes title row 
	â€” it has only one text field in it.
	
	In this case we create a new id called text1. The + after the 
	@ in the id string indicates that the id should be automatically 
	created as a resource if it does not already exist, so we are 
	defining text1 on the fly and then using it.
